i think i am up to something

[ first time using virtual env , idk how it is done]

if testing it , launch main.py

to test the updater , go to config.json and change the 0.0.0 to any number you like ( eg 4.2.0) and then start the program

also do `python -m venv myenv`
then activate `myenv` virtual env depending on your os ,for linux it is ```source myenv/bin/activate```
